Subdirectory fasttree2019 contains the source for an R library.
Run 'R CMD INSTALL fasttree2019' in the top level directory to install it.
(Tested in Linux. It should not be hard to adapt to Windows.)

runSim.R: an R script to run the simulations, writing results to directory
   'results'.
runSim.jobs: calls 'runSim.R' over the grid of parameters used in the paper.
   This can be run as a Unix shell script, or as each command is independent
   of the others, it can be run with the 'parallel' tool, e.g.:
   $ parallel :::: runSim.jobs
combine.pl: script to combine the output of many runSim.R runs into a single
   output file 'combined.txt' (R text file format.)
zachos_correl_and_calc_gsmax1.csv:
OU_parameters_full_data.csv:
   data files read by runSim.R.
OUtest.R: run comparisons between fasttree and rTrait
OUtest.jobs: runs OUtest.R over a grid of parameters. It can be run with the
   'parallel' tool.
OUanalysis.R: after running OUtest.jobs, accumulates the results into a
   summary output file CompareAll.csv.


Makefile: makes debug_tree_climb executable and (if necessary) compiles/installs
   the fasttree2019 library. (Only needed for debug_tree_climb - not needed to
   compile the library.)
debug_tree_climb: This is just a wrapper around the Fortran code in
   fasttree2019, primarily to allow running that code in a debugger.
   Usage:
   fasttree2019 [<inputfile>] [<debugflag>]
   where <inputfile> can be test0.txt or test1.txt (or a file of your making),
   defaulting to test0.txt. Any second argument (<debugflag>) enables extra
   debugging output.
test0.txt: an input file for debug_tree_climb. This is a 1700 taxon tree
   randomly generated by runSim.R
test1.txt: an input file for debug_tree_climb. This is a hand-crafted small
   tree.

The tree in test1.txt looks like this:
'e1'=event 1, 's1' = sample 1.

I've named the library fasttree2019 rather than just fasttree, as this
library probably won't see much use, and someone with something more
significant might want the fasttree name.
