Title: Simulate Continuous Trait on Tree With Sampling At Specified Times
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: c(person("Michael", "Woodhams", role = c("aut", "cre"), 
      email = "michael.woodhams@utas.edu.au"),
    person("Nicholas", "Beeton", email = "", role = "aut"),
    person("Gregory", "Jordan", email = "greg.jordan@utas.edu.au", role = "ctb"))
Description: Simulates a birth/death tree, and evolves a continous trait over
    the tree under a Brownian motion (random walk) or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
    process. The trait values on all extant branches will be recorded at
    specified times. The tree is built to have a specified number of terminal
    tips, but is not constrained to have never had more than this number of
    tips in the past.
